    "1. Write code that can generate a plot of the runtime of code.\n",
    "2. Practice finding the time complexity in big-O notation of code\n",
    "\n",

    "### Task 0:\n",
    " Write a higher-order function `plotRuntimes` that takes as a parameter a function `func`, and a list of lists that will be inputs for `func`.  Your function `plotRuntimes` should call `func` on each of the provided inputs, and record the running time. You should collect those runtimes, and plot them using `matplotlib`, with the runtimes on the y-axis and the sizes of the lists on the x-axis.  Save or display the figure.\n",

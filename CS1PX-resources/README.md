# CP1PX Resources

This is where I will upload the solutions to weekly exercises after labs, so that students have a chance to try the exercises and then check out the solutions here. If you're at the start of the course, there may be very little here! I'll try and include links to the lecturer's repo, [Jess Enright](https://github.com/magicicada/cs1px_2021) for each cycle. You can find the original lab exercises in Jupyter notebooks in Jess' repo, and I'll upload notebooks with solutions here when labs are all finished for that weekly cycle.


If you can't get the Juypyter Notebooks to load in Github, this is a common issue usually with the error message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" Fix: try copying the address to the notebook you're trying to view into [this site](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) - you should be able to view it there.


## Cycle 1: Refresher

Mostly refresher material that should help you get started in this course by revising some basic Python you should have learned already - if you haven't, it's probably because you aren't taking 1PX at the University of Glasgow. That's okay, some light Googling should bring you up to speed. If you need a hand, get in touch [here](https://ethankelly.github.io/contact/).

## Cycle 2: Fancy Functions

This is where we get to play with _higher order_ and _recursive_ functions. Higher order functions are functions that take another function as an argument (parameter) - if you're mathematically minded, it's like a composite function. Recursive functions are functions that call themselves somewhere in their code.

## Cycle 3: Errors and Exceptions

This cycle gives you some different ways to deal with when your code goes wrong, through for instance dodgy user input or some rogue bug you may have missed. Having exceptions makes the task of debugging a lot faster! Here, you will also get to tackle some much larger pieces of code.

## Cycle 4: Functions for Data Structures and Plotting

Here, we will look more into planning appropriate data structures and writing structures to deal with the data we have stored. We will also look briefly at a Python _library_ which can help us plot the data we store.

## Cycle 5: Computational Complexity

This is a big change of pace, but a really useful one for further computing science study. Computational complexity is a formal way of describing how long it should take for code to run as a function of the size of the inputs.

## Cycle 6: Searching

This cycle focuses on _searching algorithms,_ which are processes designed to check for a given element in a data structure. This cycle will focus on a simple search and a binary search.

## Cycle 7: Sorting

Sorting algorithms are processes which aim to place the elements of a given data structure into a particular order.

## Cycle 8: Sorting and Custom Data Structures

This cycle will round up and extend what you've learned in cycles 7 and 4. We will use sorting algorithms on custom data structures, which is a very useful skill to develop.

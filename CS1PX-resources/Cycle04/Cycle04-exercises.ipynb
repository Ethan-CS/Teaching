    "# Cycle 4 Lab Exercises - Functions for Data Structures and Plotting\n",

    "### Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To get more practice devising a data structure, and writing functions to process it\n",
    "2. To make use of a library (`matplotlib`), and practice various kinds of plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™ll be working with a made-up dataset containing information about the production of a fictional vegetable called a poturnip (these data are fake, but their distribution and format are the same as some real agricultural data I have worked with). On each line of the file` poturnip.csv` are four pieces of information associated with a single sale of a shipment of poturnip:\n",

    "### Task 0: Designing your data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the file` poturnip.csv`\n",
    "2. Devise your own data structure to store the information in this file, and hand-write out your plan.\n",
    "    1. Write out an example of how your data structure might store the information in the first three lines of the file\n",
    "3. Write a function to read the information in poturnip.csv and store the information in your data structure.  "

    "1. Write a function `filterByRegion(dataStruct, regionString)` that takes your data structure and a string specifying a region as parameters, and returns a new data structure containing only the information for sales from the region specified by `regionString`.\n",

    "3. Write a function` getPricesPerUnit(dataStruct)` that takes your data structure, and returns a list of the prices/unit stored in that data structure (the first column in the file).\n",
    "4. Write a function` getCostsPerUnit(dataStruct)` that takes your data structure, and returns a list of the production cost/unit stored in that data structure (the second column in the file).\n",
    "5. Write a function `calculateProfitPerUnit(dataStruct)` that takes your data structure, and returns a list of the profits for the sales (the difference between the price paid and the costs)."

Write code to produce new data structures with data selected in this way, and produce box-plots for profits in each region in each season.

I will also ask you to try to identify bugs in a binary search implementation.  It may help to trace the operation of the code by hand, to see where it goes wrong.  \n",

    "1. Implement a simple linear search that takes a list and a value, and returns the index of the value if it is present in the list.  \n",
    "2. Now, add a counter to your function that counts how many items in the list are compared to your target item.\n",
    "3. Generate a 100-item list containing the number 0 to 99.  Then generate 100 shuffles of this list (you may with to use the random.shuffle function within the random library - look up what it does and try it out.), and use your code from (b) to count how many comparisons are used to find the item 42 in each of your shuffled lists.  What is the mean of these numbers? Is it as you expect?"

You will learn more from this exercise if you don’t look at a correct copy of binary search while doing it, and don’t compare across buggy versions until you are done.  I suggest you work on them one at a time.  You should be able to give an input to each piece of buggy code that shows the problem when you trace the operation on that input."

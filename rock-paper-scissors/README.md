# Rock Paper Scissors

This directory contains Java files for a version of Rock Paper Scissors. The version here was developed intially by @DerekSomerville [Derek's Github](https://github.com/DerekSomerville) for the Foundations of Professional Software Engineering course I helped by tutoring in 2020. I really enjoy this version of the game, not least because you can play within the context of Lord of the Rings or Star Wars, but because you can add any context you like in the configuration file! The high cohesion and low coupling makes this a really great project, and I hope that - whether you're here from the FPSE course or elsewhere - you enjoy learning with and adapting this project.

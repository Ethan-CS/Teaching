    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Jupyter, please follow [this guide](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2538141/mod_resource/content/1/JupyterGuide2016%20%281%29.pdf) (I know it is written refering to a lab machine, please just pretend it says 'your machine'). To run Jupyter on your own machine, I suggest you install via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - I'll do a demo of running a notebook this way in one of our first lectures.  If you really cannot run Jupyter on your machine, it is possible to run notebooks entirely online using (for example) [Google's colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Cocalc](https://cocalc.com/)"

# CP1PX Resources

This is where I will upload the solutions to weekly exercises after labs, so that students have a chance to try the exercises and then check out the solutions here. If you're at the start of the course, there may be very little here!

## Cycle 1

Mostly refresher material that should help you get started in this course by revising some basic Python you should have learned already - if you haven't, it's probably because you aren't taking 1PX at the University of Glasgow. That's okay, some light Googling should bring up what you're looking for.

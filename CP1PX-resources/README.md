# CP1PX Resources

This is where I will upload the solutions to weekly exercises after labs, so that students have a chance to try the exercises and then check out the solutions here. If you're at the start of the course, there may be very little here! I'll try and include links to the lecturer's repo, [Jess Enright](https://github.com/magicicada/cs1px_2021) for each cycle.

## Cycle 1: Refresher

Mostly refresher material that should help you get started in this course by revising some basic Python you should have learned already - if you haven't, it's probably because you aren't taking 1PX at the University of Glasgow. That's okay, some light Googling should bring up what you're looking for.

## Cycle 2: Fancy Functions

This is where we get to play with _higher order_ and _recursive_ functions. Higher order functions are functions that take another function as an argument (parameter) - if you're mathematically minded, it's like a composite function. Recursive functions are functions that call themselves somewhere in their code.

## Cycle 3: Errors and Exceptions

This cycle gives you some different ways to deal with when your code goes wrong, through for instance dodgy user input or some rogue bug you may have missed. Having exceptions makes the task of debugging a lot faster! Here, you will also get to tackle some much larger pieces of code.
